## Summary

The Dendron community survey provides insight into who uses Dendron, allowing us to better understand our users and how we can improve the overall experience.

## Details

Do you use Dendron? We'd love to hear from you!

- [Dendron User Survey](https://link.dendron.so/74EI)

The survey shouldn't take much longer than a few minutes. We accept submissions all year round. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out:

* [Dendron Discord](https://link.dendron.so/discord)
* [Dendron Twitter](https://link.dendron.so/twitter)

We encourage sharing links to our survey on social media, and with others that are using or testing out Dendron.
